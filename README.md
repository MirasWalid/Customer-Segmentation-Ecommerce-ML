# Customer Segmentation with E-commerce Data

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using clustering techniques and classification methods on e-commerce data. It also integrates text data through word embeddings and provides an interactive dashboard for insights.

## Project Goals

- Identify meaningful customer segments based on purchase behavior and text data.
- Predict customer group membership using classification models.
- Provide actionable insights to support marketing and customer relationship strategies.
- Present results interactively using a dashboard.

## Methods

- **Feature Engineering**: RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value), integration of text features using word embeddings.
- **Clustering**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering (Dendrogram visualization).
- **Classification**: k-NN classifier, neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron).
- **Visualization**: t-SNE, PCA, Dendrogram plots.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Streamlit to explore clusters and customer insights.
